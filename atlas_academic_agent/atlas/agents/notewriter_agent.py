                   • Multiple Integrals → volume/area
                   • Vector Calculus → flow/force/rotation
                   • KEY FORMULAS:
                     - Triple integrals in cylindrical/spherical coords
                     - Curl, divergence, gradient relationships

                2. COMMON EXAM PATTERNS:
                   • Find critical points
                   • Calculate flux/work
                   • Optimize with constraints

                3. QUICKSTART GUIDE:
                   • Always draw 3D diagrams
                   • Check units match
                   • Use symmetry to simplify

                4. EMERGENCY TIPS:
                   • If stuck, try converting coordinates
                   • Check boundary conditions
                   • Look for special patterns"""
